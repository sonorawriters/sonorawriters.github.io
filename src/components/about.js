    <p>
      The Sonora Writers Group is comprised of both published and aspiring
      authors, who have found themselves in the heart of Californiaâ€™s historic
      Gold Rush Country. We are all writers and poets whose works run within
      many genres, and who have come together to promote the written word and
      support each other in finding their voices within the art of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We meet monthly to read and critique all manners of writing.{" "}

The event begins at 10 am in the education room with Jim and Joan Allday, docents and board members, sharing a slide show about some of the more notable trees, along with stories and key information about the grove and its trees. Some of the information is usually reserved for notable people, but the docents will share this with us on May 4. Writers and artists then walk down to the North Grove Trail and select the tree that will become the subject of their writing and/or art. A sharing of writing back in the education room at 3 pm will conclude the day.</p>\n<p>Bring your lunch, snacks, water, and materials. Also bring a folding chair or something to sit on. Benches are not placed at every tree. Prepare for any inclement weather. This is a rain-or-shine event.</p>\n<p>This is a Free event.

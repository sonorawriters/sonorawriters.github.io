&lt;p&gt;Writing Down the Big Trees – Free Event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 4 – 10 am – 4 pm at Calaveras Big Trees State Park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poets, writers, journaling fans, and artists gather on Sunday, May 4, at Calaveras Big Trees State Park North Grove to write about and sketch one of the giant Sequoias of their choice for inclusion in an anthology for a Fall 2025 release. The event begins at 10 am in the education room with Jim and Joan Allday, docents and board members, sharing a slide show about some of the more notable trees, along with stories and key information about the grove and its trees. Some of the information is usually reserved for notable people, but the docents will share this with us on May 4. Writers and artists then walk down to the North Grove Trail and select the tree that will become the subject of their writing and/or art. A sharing of writing back in the education room at 3 pm will conclude the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your lunch, snacks, water, and materials. Also bring a folding chair or something to sit on. Benches are not placed at every tree. Prepare for any inclement weather. This is a rain-or-shine event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Free event. There is an entrance fee to the park that is assessed per car, and parking may be limited. The education room will open at 9 am. and there will be hot coffee/tea, rolls, and water available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reservation required. Contact Monika Rose, Calaveras County Poet Laureate, at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:manzanitawp@gmail.com&quot;&gt;manzanitawp@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell all your creative friends to join you!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Fridays in the Foothills… A poetry & prose open mic for all ages]]></title><description><![CDATA[First Fridays in the foothills… a poetry & prose open mic for all ages 6:30-8:00pm, starting March 7, 2025

The readings will take place from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM at Revive Coffee, located at 81 S. Washington Street in downtown Sonora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rain Will Come marks the group’s first published collection of original stories, poems, and essays in over a decade. Saturday’s reading is one of several events the group has planned to celebrate the publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re doing something a little different from what you usually see during Second Saturday,” says writer Blanche Abrams. “This is a safe and comfortable space where writers can share and express their art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anthology features captivating illustrations contributed by local artists, adding a unique visual dimension to the creative work. Scheduled participants include Cyndie Zikmund, Amy Lee, Glenn Ditman, Connie Corcoran, John Accurso, aryeÁnna Ross, Blanche Abrams, Nick Hugues, and Sara Dykman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editor Kate Sills shares her enthusiasm: “During the last reading at Revive in December, I was blown away by the performances of the authors and poets. The fact that this abundance of local talent is concentrated in one night and offered for free is what I love about Sonora’s Second Saturday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copies of When Rain Will Come will be available for purchase at the event. The anthology can also be found at Mountain Bookshop, Wildbud in downtown Sonora, the Independent Mercantile in Murphys, and through the Sonora Writers Group’s website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonorawriters.com/book/&quot;&gt;sonorawriters.com/book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

When Rain Will Come marks the group’s first published collection of original stories, poems, and essays in over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The book is entirely the work of our community – the writing, the artwork, the editing, all of it,” says editor Kate Sills. “There’s a certain wild joy seeing how everything fell into place with the result being this amazing collection from writers in our very own backyard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anthology features captivating illustrations contributed by local artists, adding a unique visual dimension to the creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s reading is the first of several public events the group is planning to celebrate the publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We all come from different backgrounds and experiences, and this diversity of styles and subject matter comes together in a relatable way,” adds Sills. “There’s something in our stories and poems for everyone.”
Copies of When Rain Will Come will be available for purchase at the event and can also be found at Mountain Bookshop and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lulu.com/shop/amylee-and-sara-dykman-and-blanche-abrams-and-kate-sills/when-rain-will-come/paperback/product-84n7ygd.html&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Members of the Sonora Writers Group will present readings from their newly published anthology, When Rain Will Come, during the February 8th Second Saturday Sonora Art Walk. The readings will take place from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM at Revive Coffee, located at 81 S. Washington Street in downtown Sonora.

When Rain Will Come marks the group’s first published collection of original stories, poems, and essays in over a decade. Saturday’s reading is one of several events the group has planned to celebrate the publication.

"We're doing something a little different from what you usually see during Second Saturday," says writer Blanche Abrams. "This is a safe and comfortable space where writers can share and express their art."

The anthology features captivating illustrations contributed by local artists, adding a unique visual dimension to the creative work. Scheduled participants include Cyndie Zikmund, Amy Lee, Glenn Ditman, Connie Corcoran, John Accurso, aryeÁnna Ross, Blanche Abrams, Nick Hugues, and Sara Dykman.

Editor Kate Sills shares her enthusiasm: "During the last reading at Revive in December, I was blown away by the performances of the authors and poets. The fact that this abundance of local talent is concentrated in one night and offered for free is what I love about Sonora's Second Saturday."

Copies of When Rain Will Come will be available for purchase at the event. The anthology can also be found at Mountain Bookshop, Wildbud in downtown Sonora, the Independent Mercantile in Murphys, and through the Sonora Writers Group’s website at [sonorawriters.com/book](https://sonorawriters.com/book/).

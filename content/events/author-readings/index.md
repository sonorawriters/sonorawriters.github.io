Members of the Sonora Writers Group will present readings from their newly published anthology, When Rain Will Come, during the December 14th 2nd Saturday arts event. The readings will take place from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM at Revive Coffee, located at 81 S. Washington Street in downtown Sonora.
When Rain Will Come marks the group’s first published collection of original stories, poems, and essays in over a decade.

"The book is entirely the work of our community – the writing, the artwork, the editing, all of it," says editor Kate Sills. "There’s a certain wild joy seeing how everything fell into place with the result being this amazing collection from writers in our very own backyard.”

The anthology features captivating illustrations contributed by local artists, adding a unique visual dimension to the creative work.

Saturday’s reading is the first of several public events the group is planning to celebrate the publication.

Saturday's scheduled participants include Kate Sills, Sara Dykman, ayreÁnna Ross, Laurel Leslie and Matt Peller, Glenn Dittman, John Accurso, Amy Lee, and Blanche Abrams.

“We all come from different backgrounds and experiences, and this diversity of styles and subject matter comes together in a relatable way," adds Sills. "There's something in our stories and poems for everyone."
Copies of When Rain Will Come will be available for purchase at the event and can also be found at Mountain Bookshop and [online](https://www.lulu.com/shop/amylee-and-sara-dykman-and-blanche-abrams-and-kate-sills/when-rain-will-come/paperback/product-84n7ygd.html).

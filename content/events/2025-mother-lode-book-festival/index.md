Writing Down the Big Trees – Free Event

May 4 – 10 am – 4 pm at Calaveras Big Trees State Park

Poets, writers, journaling fans, and artists gather on Sunday, May 4, at Calaveras Big Trees State Park North Grove to write about and sketch one of the giant Sequoias of their choice for inclusion in an anthology for a Fall 2025 release. The event begins at 10 am in the education room with Jim and Joan Allday, docents and board members, sharing a slide show about some of the more notable trees, along with stories and key information about the grove and its trees. Some of the information is usually reserved for notable people, but the docents will share this with us on May 4. Writers and artists then walk down to the North Grove Trail and select the tree that will become the subject of their writing and/or art. A sharing of writing back in the education room at 3 pm will conclude the day.

Bring your lunch, snacks, water, and materials. Also bring a folding chair or something to sit on. Benches are not placed at every tree. Prepare for any inclement weather. This is a rain-or-shine event.

This is a Free event. There is an entrance fee to the park that is assessed per car, and parking may be limited. The education room will open at 9 am. and there will be hot coffee/tea, rolls, and water available.

Reservation required. Contact Monika Rose, Calaveras County Poet Laureate, at <manzanitawp@gmail.com>

Tell all your creative friends to join you!
